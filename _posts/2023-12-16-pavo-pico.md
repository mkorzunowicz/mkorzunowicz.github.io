After a couple of months of struggling whether I really want to get the new DJI FPV Goggles 2, the price finally dropped. While I usually don't want to spend ridiculous amounts of money on FPV drones, it is an expensive hobby. So I kinda needed to get over it. My primary concern was that I don't fly much recently. The biggest problem being - I can't really fly within the city's limits with most of my quads. Ever since DJI made the Air Unit O3, I questioned whether it's reasonable to move away from the GoPro and replace it with DJI's Air Unit, since it also has a gyro on board. Quality wise all I found on the internet is that for professional use, GoPro is a must. But am I a professional FPV pilot? My biggest concern is still weight and security of flying in urban areas. So lightweight, safe drone should still be my weapon of choice.
