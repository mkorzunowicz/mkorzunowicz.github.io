# So who am I anyway?

> A software developer. A Team Lead. A nerd, but without a confusing interface. Tends to get along with the less and the more technically inclined. Tries not to take knowledge for granted. Enjoys challenges and learning new things - not only technical. Thorough and incquisitive. Loves solitude, but thrives with a partner/team. Not afraid to ask the hard questions, even if they aren't comfortable. Jack of all trades. Not sure if master of any.
